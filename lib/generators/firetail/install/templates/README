====================================================================================

Thank you for installing Firetail!

Before you start using firetail, please edit the file in "config/firetail.yml"
with your API Key, Token and URL first before running your Rails app.

The middleware is already configured in "config/application.rb" (you can check that)

Also we have installed a sample copy of schema.json in "config/schema.json" (your API schema) 
for you to better understand and create your schema based on your needs.

Happy coding!
