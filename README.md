# Firetail

Welcome to the Firetail Ruby gem. Before we start, ensure that your ruby version is 2.7 or greater. We do not support ruby versions lower than 2.7.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'firetail'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself with:

    $ gem install firetail

Finally, if you are using Rails, run:

    $ rails g firetail:install

This will configure your Rails app to use the Firetail gem as middleware, and generate configuration and json schema templates.

## Usage

1. Setup your Firetail key and Firetail backend URL by setting the environment variables `FIRETAIL_API_KEY` and `FIRETAIL_URL`
2. Update `config/schema.json` to match your API endpoints.
3. That's it! Happy coding!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
